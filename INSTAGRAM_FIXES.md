# Instagram Integration Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Instagram Connection "No User Found" Error

**Problem**: When trying to connect Instagram, the API was returning "no user found" error even though the user exists.

**Root Cause**: The `user_connections` table was missing from the database, causing the Instagram connect API to fail.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `/app/api/instagram/connect/route.ts` to handle missing tables gracefully
- Added fallback mechanisms to try multiple table options:
  1. `user_connections` table (preferred)
  2. `user_profiles` table (fallback)
  3. `users` table (final fallback)
- Created database setup script `scripts/fix-instagram-integration.sql`
- Added setup page at `/setup-instagram` to run database setup

### 2. Page Reload Loading Timeout

**Problem**: When reloading the page, the auth context was timing out and not loading any data, showing timeout errors in the console.

**Root Cause**: The profile fetching logic had too many retries and long timeouts, causing the UI to get stuck in loading state.

**Solution**:
- Reduced timeout from 8 seconds to 5 seconds in auth context
- Simplified profile fetching to single attempt instead of multiple retries
- Reduced fallback timeout from 15 seconds to 10 seconds
- Reduced profile timeout from 5 seconds to 3 seconds
- Added better error handling and state management
- Added timeout protection to dashboard data fetching

## Files Modified

### Core Fixes
- `app/api/instagram/connect/route.ts` - Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms
- `contexts/auth-context.tsx` - Reduced timeouts and simplified profile fetching
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added timeout protection for data fetching

### New Files
- `scripts/fix-instagram-integration.sql` - Database setup script
- `app/api/setup-instagram/route.ts` - API endpoint to run database setup
- `app/setup-instagram/page.tsx` - Setup page for Instagram integration
- `INSTAGRAM_FIXES.md` - This documentation file

## How to Fix

### Step 1: Run Database Setup
1. Navigate to `/setup-instagram` in your browser
2. Click "Check Status" to see what's missing
3. Click "Run Setup" to create missing tables and columns
4. Verify that all checks pass

### Step 2: Test Instagram Connection
1. Try connecting Instagram again
2. The connection should now work with better error handling
3. If it still fails, check the browser console for specific error messages

### Step 3: Test Page Reload
1. Reload the dashboard page
2. The loading should complete much faster
3. No more timeout errors in the console

## Database Changes

The setup script creates/updates:
- `user_connections` table for platform connections
- Instagram-specific columns in `users` table
- Instagram-specific columns in `messages` table  
- Instagram-specific columns in `chats` table
- Required indexes and RLS policies
- Database functions for Instagram integration

## Error Handling Improvements

### Instagram Connect API
- Graceful fallback through multiple table options
- Better error messages and logging
- Handles missing tables without crashing

### Auth Context
- Faster timeout resolution
- Single attempt profile fetching
- Better state management
- Prevents infinite loading states

### Dashboard
- Added timeout protection
- Better error messages
- Improved loading state management

## Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Run the database setup
2. Try connecting Instagram
3. Reload the dashboard page multiple times
4. Check browser console for any remaining errors

The fixes should resolve both the Instagram connection issue and the page reload timeout problem.
